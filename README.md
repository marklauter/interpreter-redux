# interpreter-redux
The current goal is to construct a predicate expression some a statement resembling a simple SQL where clause.

This started as a port of the TeCom Interlane residential utility billing language interpreter from C to C#. Interpreter was originally conceived by Gary Speegle and written by Speegle and myself sometime between 1996 and 1998 when we worked together at TeCom, A TECO Energy Company. TeCom built energy management systems for commercial and residential markets.
